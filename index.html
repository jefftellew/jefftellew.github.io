      <h3>Hi, I'm <b>Jeff</b>!</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a full-stack software engineer from San Diego, CA who loves to program, game, travel, and exercise.
        I've worked on a wide range of projects from more typical things like web development and Android apps to newer fields like blockchain and augmented/virtual reality.

      <h3>CertificateChain</h3>
      <p>
        As part of my internship at the UC San Diego Division of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI), I created CertificateChain, a decentralized database system built on the <span class="skill">Ethereum Blockchain</span>, culminating in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jamiaopen/ooac019">publication in JAMIA Open</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Biomedical informatics requires the usage of public health datasets, which typically require certifications before researchers are granted access.
        Prior to this, DBMI staff had to request these certificates by email, resulting in a number of problems outlined in the paper.
        CertificateChain used <span class="skill">Solidity</span> smart contracts to store data to the blockchain, where it could be easily accessed by staff or viewed by others via a web app that I created with <span class="skill">Java</span> and <span class="skill">Spring Boot</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To perform data collection in preparation for the paper, I wrote <span class="skill">BASH</span> scripts to automate testing which ran on across a few <span class="skill">AWS Virtual Machines</span>.
        I then did the data analysis with <span class="skill">R</span> and created graphics for the paper.

      <h3>UltraTracker</h3>
      <p>
        During another internship at UCSD, this time in the Simulation Training Center (STC), I worked on UltraTracker, an <span class="skill">augmented reality</span> training system for students at the UCSD School of Medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon-to-be doctors at the STC perform training exercises intended to give them experience in real-life situations without worrying about real-life consequences.
        One of the situations they train for is called a <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/23927-central-venous-catheter">central line</a>, and is notoriously difficult to learn.
      </p>

      <p>
        UltraTracker aimed to ease this difficult learning curve in two different ways.
        First, it gave students a real-time overlay via augmented reality of their ultrasound data, motion-tracked to the position of the ultrasound probe.
        It displayed metrics via <span class="skill">Qt</span> and <span class="skill">C++</span>, such as needle-probe alignment, to help them learn more quickly with real-time empirical feedback.
        Second, it allowed experienced doctors to replay the trainees practice attempts by re-rendering their actions using <span class="skill">OpenGL</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, the technology is still private, so I cannot link the code here.

      <h3>Prometheus</h3>
      <p>
        Though I had dabbled in game modding and development before (see below), my first formal step on the path to becoming software engineer was when I signed up for AP Computer Science in 2015.
        The end result of that class was a simple tower defense game, named Prometheus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Written entirely in <span class="skill">Java</span>, Prometheus is far from a masterpiece -- it was, after all, the first thing I ever truly made with code. It doesn't elicit the same reaction you might have when you read about blockchains or augmented reality.
        And yet, I can't bring myself to leave it off this page because of a much simpler reason.
        To me, this game represents the beginning of my love for something that I would go on to pursue most likely for the rest of my life. Something that I hope that you, dear reader, once experienced as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you'd like to play the game, you'll need <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/windows_manual.jsp">a JRE installation</a>.

      <h3>Team Fortress 2 Maps</h3>
      <p>
        In late 2014, I organized a community Team Fortress 2 (TF2) tournament where participants from around the globe competed against each other to see who was the best of the best.
        In this tournament, the winner was decided by speed. The person with the fastest time to complete three different levels took home the first place prize.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to organizing community crowdfunding for prizes, scheduling, and other administrative duties, I created one of the custom levels for the tournament.
        This was the culmination of what had been about 3 years of developing what are known as "maps" for the game, the worlds within which players actually play the game.
      </p>

      <p>
        This interesting in creating my own content for Valve's <span class="skill">Source Engine</span> using their <span class="skill">Hammer Editor</span> was the first time I dipped my toes in the vast ocean of computer science.
